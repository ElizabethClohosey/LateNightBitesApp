# Late Nite Bites
### Satiate your hunger

Buzzed, stumbling… voracious hunger. Has it been days? Weeks? So much liquid. So much, but never enough to satiate the hunger. The hunger drives us now. The hunger… until we remember… there’s an app for that. An app whose sole purpose is to sate this driving, cloying hunger; to placate these wretched pangs for sustenance. We can just navigate these dark, starlit streets through this app, the beacon which calls us, will nourish us. 

Neon signs, nearly blindingly bright, light our way out of the haze. The app knows what we want. Finally, we have arrived. We have found what we crave, lust for, covet. All-consuming warmth, heavenly aroma; we devour that which is brought forth from heated caverns, sweltering, scorching magic, combining elements, stirring rapture!  We are sated, and ever so relieved to have found that which we yearn.

This app; this miraculous monolith for satisfying desires must receive the highest praise, extoling it’s worth to those who hunger as we do. We must endorse thee… the highest rating… five stars.

Late-night hunger strikes for many after kitchens have closed. Where can one find food? Look no further than Late Nite Bites, an app dedicated to finding the food you crave in the mid-night hours.
Late Nite Bites uses google maps and yelp APIs to bring about functionality specific to late-night nourishment. Using google maps to find your location, yelp is then able to find restaurants open.
